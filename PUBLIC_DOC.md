    # ClaryVyb: Supercharge Your AI Interactions

    **Stop wasting time and money on bad prompts. Start getting the results you want, faster.**

    ClaryVyb is a powerful, intuitive Chrome extension that acts as your personal AI prompt engineer. It sits right in your browser, helping you craft perfect prompts that save you money on tokens, reduce retries, and boost your productivity.

    Whether you're a developer, a writer, a student, or just an AI enthusiast, ClaryVyb is your secret weapon for getting the most out of any AI platform.

    ## The Problem: Ambiguous Prompts are Costing You

    Every time you send a vague or poorly structured prompt to an AI, you're rolling the dice. You might get the perfect response, or you might get a completely useless one. This back-and-forth costs you:

    *   **Time:** You're stuck in a loop of re-writing and re-submitting, trying to coax the right answer out of the AI.
    *   **Money:** With token-based pricing, every failed attempt is a drain on your credits and your wallet.
    *   **Profit:** For professionals, wasted time is wasted profit. The longer it takes to get the right result, the less you earn.

    ## The Solution: ClaryVyb's Two-Pronged Attack

    ClaryVyb offers two powerful features to eliminate ambiguity and supercharge your prompts:

    ### 1. Clarify: The Prompt Architect

    Turn your vague ideas into detailed, actionable blueprints. The "Clarify" function takes your input and transforms it into a structured, easy-to-understand prompt that leaves no room for error.

    **Before ClaryVyb:**
    > "Write me a plan for a YouTube video about AI tools."

    **After ClaryVyb's "Clarify":**
    > **🎯 Goal:** Create a well-structured YouTube video plan showcasing AI tools.
    >
    > **🧩 Main Steps:**
    > 1.  Identify trending AI tools in 2025.
    > 2.  Research their features and use cases.
    > 3.  Draft a script outline (intro, demo, conclusion).
    > 4.  Add beginner-friendly tips.
    >
    > **✅ Actionable To-Dos:**
    > *   List 5 tools with accurate descriptions.
    > *   Keep script under 10 minutes.
    > *   Use simple language.
    >
    > **⚠️ Edge Cases & Safeguards:**
    > *   Avoid outdated tools.
    > *   Cite credible sources.
    > *   Keep script engaging, not overly technical.

    With "Clarify," you get a comprehensive, well-thought-out prompt that anticipates problems and ensures you get the right result the first time.

    ### 2. Concise: The Editor

    Cut through the noise and get straight to the point. The "Concise" function takes your long, rambling prompts and distills them into their essential elements, preserving your original intent while making them more efficient and cost-effective.

    **Before ClaryVyb:**
    > "I need to write some unit tests for my Express.js API. I want to test the CRUD operations for the /tasks endpoint, and I also need to make sure that the JWT authentication is working correctly. I should probably test for valid, invalid, and missing tokens. And I need to handle errors, like when the database is down or when the user provides invalid input. Can you help me with that?"

    **After ClaryVyb's "Concise":**
    > "Write Jest unit tests for an Express.js API: CRUD /tasks, JWT (valid/invalid/missing), errors (inputs, DB). Include success + failure coverage, modular file structure, env vars, clear comments."

    With "Concise," you get a lean, token-efficient prompt that delivers the same results with less waste.
