core audience (Vibe Coders / AI-heavy users) are the ones who bleed money when their prompts are ambiguous: every misstep costs extra tokens, extra retries, extra wasted credits. By clarifying prompts into structured, edge-case-proof blueprints, you’re literally saving them money and increasing efficiency. That’s your killer value proposition.

But here’s the beauty:

Writers / marketers → They’ll use Concise to strip fluff from prompts (better ad copy, headlines, instructions).

Researchers / students → They’ll use Clarify to structure tasks (summaries, study guides, research outlines).

Business people → They’ll use Clarify to turn vague requests into roadmaps and to-dos.

Casual AI users → They’ll love Concise for asking AI things more cleanly.

So yeah — your MVP positioning is coders, but the tool is horizontal. The same “reduce ambiguity + save time + save money” resonates everywhere. Think Grammarly: started for students, now used by lawyers, marketers, CEOs.

👉 My recommendation:

Brand/market it around Vibe coders (your early adopters, the niche you understand deeply).

Build messaging broad enough that anyone frustrated with AI misinterpretation will see value.

===================================


Button Responsibility Mapping (Refined)
1. Clarify → “The Prompt Architect”

Personality: Acts like an expert AI prompt engineer.

Output Style:

Restructures the prompt into:

🎯 Clear goal statement

🧩 Main steps the AI should follow

✅ Actionable todos / instructions list

⚠️ Potential edge cases & guardrails to avoid common AI failures (ambiguity, hallucination, over-explaining, etc.)

Always ensures the rewritten prompt is practical, precise, and safe.

Use Case: Best when user is writing complex, multi-step prompts.

2. Concise → “The Editor”

Personality: A sharp, no-nonsense text editor.

Output Style:

Removes fluff, redundancies, or over-explanations.

Keeps original intent intact — no new proactive structure or safeguards added.

Delivers a straight-to-the-point version of the same prompt.

Use Case: Best when user wants brevity without added strategy.

3. Copy → “The Assistant”

Personality: A helpful sidekick.

Output Style:

Instantly copies output text to clipboard.

Shows a subtle confirmation ("Copied! ✅").

Use Case: Keeps workflow smooth, non-intrusive.

⚡ So in practice:

Clarify = prompt architect (adds structure + foresight)

Concise = text trimmer (just makes it short and sharp)

==============================================

🏗 Clarify Output Format (Structured Sections)

When the user clicks Clarify, the rewritten prompt should always return in Markdown-style headings:

🎯 Goal

A single sentence that defines the core intent of the prompt.

🧩 Main Steps

A numbered list of steps the AI should follow.

✅ Actionable To-Dos

A clear checklist the AI can directly execute.

⚠️ Edge Cases & Safeguards

Anticipated problems + instructions to prevent them.

Example Transformation

Original Prompt:
"Write me a plan for a YouTube video about AI tools."

Clarified Output:

🎯 Goal  
Create a well-structured YouTube video plan showcasing AI tools.  

🧩 Main Steps  
1. Identify trending AI tools in 2025.  
2. Research their key features and use cases.  
3. Draft a script outline with introduction, demo, and conclusion.  
4. Include tips for beginners.  

✅ Actionable To-Dos  
- List at least 5 tools with accurate descriptions.  
- Keep script under 10 minutes.  
- Use simple, beginner-friendly language.  

⚠️ Edge Cases & Safeguards  
- Avoid outdated or irrelevant tools.  
- Do not make claims without sources.  
- Ensure script is engaging but not overly technical.  


Meanwhile, Concise would just return:
"Make a 10-min YouTube video plan on trending AI tools with features, demos, and tips for beginners."

🔥 This separation keeps the two modes very distinct:

Clarify = structured, strategic, proactive

Concise = minimal, sharp, compressed



===========================================

Use Case: “Building a Backend with AI — No Token Wastage”

Context:
A Vibe Coder is working on a project where they want AI to generate a backend API for a simple task manager. They’re using GPT-4, but every time they send a prompt, the AI hallucinates, forgets error handling, or misses edge cases. They waste tokens re-explaining the same things.

❌ Original Prompt (ambiguous):

“Write me an Express.js backend for a task manager with CRUD operations and authentication.”

Problem: This looks fine, but:

No DB specified (AI might default to Mongo, Postgres, or even SQLite).

No error handling instructions.

No input validation steps.

Authentication is vague (JWT? Sessions? OAuth?).

Coder wastes money clarifying all this in follow-ups.

✅ With ClaryVyb – Clarify Button:

ClaryVyb restructures the prompt into something AI-proof:

Goal: Build a backend API for a task manager using Express.js.

Requirements:

CRUD endpoints for tasks (/tasks).

User authentication with JWT (signup, login, logout).

Store data in MongoDB (via Mongoose).

Include error handling for invalid inputs, DB failures, and missing tokens.

Validate input:

Title: string, required.

Description: string, optional.

Completed: boolean, default false.

Ensure code follows modular structure (routes/, models/, controllers/).

Deliverables:

server.js entry file.

User and Task Mongoose models.

Auth middleware for protecting routes.

Example .env file.

Edge Cases:

Prevent duplicate users on signup.

Return 401 if JWT missing or invalid.

Handle DB connection errors gracefully.

Style: Comment code clearly, keep functions small and reusable.

Now the coder sends ONE prompt instead of 5–6 fragmented ones.

The AI generates a ready-to-use backend.

No “oops, forgot auth” follow-up prompts.

They save tokens, time, and frustration.

🔥 Why This Matters:

For Vibe Coders, clarity = savings. They can:

Ship faster → no wasted cycles fixing AI hallucinations.

Spend less → fewer retries and clarifications.

Trust AI more → because ClaryVyb ensures no key requirements are skipped.

==================================

Use Case: “Summarizing Long Technical Prompts Into Lean, AI-Friendly Versions”

Context:
A Vibe Coder is writing a prompt for AI to generate unit tests for an existing project. They over-explain, dumping too much detail into GPT. The result: wasted tokens, higher costs, and sometimes the AI gets confused by the verbosity.

❌ Original Prompt (too wordy):

“I have this Express.js API with user authentication and tasks. Each task has fields for title, description, and completed. Users are stored in MongoDB with JWT authentication. I want you to write unit tests for all CRUD endpoints. Please make sure the tests are written using Jest, and also make sure that the tests include cases for error handling such as missing fields, invalid JWT, missing JWT, and DB errors. The tests should cover both success and failure cases. Make sure the file structure is correct. Also, ensure that environment variables are loaded for DB during testing. Please provide clear and commented code that I can run directly.”

Problem:

Too verbose → AI may miss key parts because of fluff.

Wasted tokens → coder pays more.

Harder to re-use → not modular.

✅ With ClaryVyb – Concise Button:

Write Jest unit tests for my Express.js API:

CRUD /tasks endpoints.

JWT authentication (valid/invalid/missing).

Error cases: invalid inputs, DB errors.

Success & failure coverage.

Use modular file structure, load env vars.

Code must be clear, commented, runnable.

⚡ Outcome:

Prompt is straight to the point.

AI uses fewer tokens → saves coder money.

More reliable output since noise is gone.

Easy for coder to reuse the same tight prompt across multiple projects.

🔑 Contrast with Clarify

Clarify = adds structure, foresight, edge cases.

Concise = strips away fluff, keeps essentials.

Together, they cover both ends of the spectrum:

Coders who are too vague.

Coders who are too verbose.
