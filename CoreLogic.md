ClaryVyb – Core Positioning & Logic
🎯 Audience & Value Proposition

My core audience is Vibe Coders / AI-heavy users. These are the people who lose the most money when their prompts are ambiguous: every unclear instruction costs extra tokens, extra retries, and wasted credits. By clarifying prompts into structured, edge-case-proof blueprints, I am literally saving them money and increasing their efficiency. That is my killer value proposition.

But the beauty of ClaryVyb is that it isn’t limited to coders:

Writers / Marketers → use Concise to strip fluff from prompts, improving ad copy, headlines, and instructions.

Researchers / Students → use Clarify to structure study tasks into summaries, outlines, and guides.

Business Professionals → use Clarify to turn vague requests into roadmaps and actionable to-dos.

Casual AI Users → use Concise to make everyday prompts cleaner and more effective.

So while my MVP is aimed at Vibe Coders (the niche I understand best), the tool is ultimately horizontal: the same principle of reduce ambiguity + save time + save money resonates across industries. Think Grammarly: it started with students but now serves marketers, lawyers, and executives.

👉 My positioning strategy is:

Market/brand around Vibe Coders first (early adopters who feel the pain the most).

Build messaging broad enough so anyone frustrated with AI misunderstandings will see the value.

🎛 Button Responsibility Mapping
1. Clarify → “The Prompt Architect”

Personality: Acts like an expert AI prompt engineer.

Output Style:

🎯 Clear goal statement.

🧩 Main steps the AI should follow.

✅ Actionable to-dos / instructions list.

⚠️ Potential edge cases & safeguards to prevent failures (ambiguity, hallucination, over-explaining, etc.).

Use Case: Best when I’m writing complex, multi-step prompts that need foresight and guardrails.

2. Concise → “The Editor”

Personality: A sharp, no-nonsense text editor.

Output Style:

Removes fluff, redundancies, or over-explanations.

Preserves original intent without adding safeguards or structure.

Returns a straight-to-the-point version of the same prompt.

Use Case: Best when I want brevity and simplicity without extra strategy.

3. Copy → “The Assistant”

Personality: A helpful sidekick.

Output Style:

Instantly copies the output text to the clipboard.

Shows a subtle confirmation message (“Copied! ✅”).

Use Case: Keeps workflow smooth and non-intrusive.

🏗 Clarify Output Format (Structured Sections)

When I click Clarify, the output should always return in Markdown-style headings for readability:

🎯 Goal → One sentence defining the core intent.

🧩 Main Steps → A numbered list of logical steps.

✅ Actionable To-Dos → A clear checklist for execution.

⚠️ Edge Cases & Safeguards → Problems + prevention measures.

Example Transformation

Original Prompt:
“Write me a plan for a YouTube video about AI tools.”

Clarified Output:
🎯 Goal
Create a well-structured YouTube video plan showcasing AI tools.

🧩 Main Steps

Identify trending AI tools in 2025.

Research their features and use cases.

Draft a script outline (intro, demo, conclusion).

Add beginner-friendly tips.

✅ Actionable To-Dos

List 5 tools with accurate descriptions.

Keep script under 10 minutes.

Use simple language.

⚠️ Edge Cases & Safeguards

Avoid outdated tools.

Cite credible sources.

Keep script engaging, not overly technical.

Concise Version:
“Make a 10-min YouTube video plan on trending AI tools with features, demos, and tips for beginners.”

🧑‍💻 Use Case 1: Building a Backend with AI — No Token Wastage

Context:
As a Vibe Coder, I’m building a backend API with GPT-4. My vague prompt makes the AI hallucinate and miss details, wasting tokens on clarifications.

❌ Original Prompt (ambiguous):
“Write me an Express.js backend for a task manager with CRUD operations and authentication.”

Problem:

DB not specified.

Authentication unclear.

No error handling or validation defined.

✅ Clarified Version with ClaryVyb:

Goal: Build Express.js backend API for task manager.

Requirements: CRUD /tasks, JWT auth, MongoDB (Mongoose), error handling, validation.

Deliverables: server.js, models, routes, middleware, .env.

Edge Cases: prevent duplicate users, handle invalid JWT, DB errors gracefully.

Result: One clean prompt instead of 5–6 retries. AI outputs production-ready backend code. I save money, time, and frustration.

📉 Use Case 2: Summarizing Long Technical Prompts

Context:
I’m writing unit test prompts but they’re too verbose, wasting tokens.

❌ Original Prompt (wordy):
Includes every detail in a long paragraph — AI may miss the essentials.

✅ Concise Version with ClaryVyb:
“Write Jest unit tests for Express.js API: CRUD /tasks, JWT (valid/invalid/missing), errors (inputs, DB). Include success + failure coverage, modular file structure, env vars, clear comments.”

Result: Lean, reusable, token-efficient prompts. AI stays focused.

🔑 Distinction Recap

Clarify = Adds structure, foresight, edge cases.

Concise = Strips fluff, keeps essentials.
Together, they serve coders who are either too vague or too verbose.
